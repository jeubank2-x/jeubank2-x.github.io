Analyzing the Influence of NBA Scheduling
"How rest days, travel, and game density impact team performance"
---

### Overview
This project explores how NBA schedule structure affects team performance. I analyzed how factors such as back-to-back games, travel distance, and rest day patterns correlate with win probability and player output. Designed and implemented an interactive scheduling and visualization tool to optimize event planning. 

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning 
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical correlation and visualization
- Presentation of actionable insights

### Tools Used
RStudio, Tidyr, DPLYR, GGPlot2

### Results
Teams consistently underperform when traveling across time zones on short rest. The effects were most noticeable in the second game of back-to-backs.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
