**Analyzing the Influence of NBA Scheduling**

---

### Overview
This project explores how NBA schedule structure affects team performance. I analyzed how factors such as back-to-back games, travel distance, and rest day patterns correlate with win probability and player output. Designed and implemented an interactive scheduling and visualization tool to optimize event planning. 

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression
- Statistical Correlation and Visualization

### Tools Used
RStudio, Tidyr, Dplyr, GGPlot2, Purrr, Stats

### Results
Teams consistently underperform when traveling across time zones on short rest. The effects were most noticeable in the second game of back-to-backs.

**MLB Player Performance Prediction Model**

---

### Overview
This project builds a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a player recording a hit or home run in a given matchup. The model uses historical player performance, opposing pitcher tendencies, stadium effects, and situational factors to predict outcomes. The model can be adjusted and used for other player data. 

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data Wrangling 
- Predictive modeling and feature selection
- Model evaluation and interpretation

### Tools Used
RStudio, Tidyr, DPLYR, Stats

### Results
The model provides probability estimates that can be used in player development, scouting evaluations, strategic lineup decisions, or performance forecasting.
